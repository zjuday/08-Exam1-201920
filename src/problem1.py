    What comes in:
      -- An rg.Square.
      -- A positive integer
      -- An rg.RoseWindow.
    What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
    Side effects:
      -- Draws, on the given rg.RoseWindow:
           -- The given rg.Square.
           -- An rg.Circle that:
                -- is directly below and touching the given rg.Square,
                -- has diameter the same as the length of each side
                     of the given rg.Square,
                -- has fill color the same as the fill color
                     of the given rg.Square, and
                -- has the given thickness as its outline thickness.
                     (SEE THE PICTURES.)
            -- An rg.Line that:
                -- has one endpoint is at the center of the above rg.Circle,
                -- has another endpoint that is at the midpoint of the
                     left side of the given rg.Square,
                -- has color the same as the outline color
                     of the given rg.Square, and
                -- has the given thickness.  (SEE THE PICTURES.)
